<p><em>Denali</em> can be used to visualize many different sources of data, but it requires that its input be in the form of a <a href="tutorial.html#scalar-tree">scalar tree</a>. <em>Denali</em> includes tools to extract tree-like structure from your data so that it can be visualized as a landscape metaphor.</p>
<p>This document describes several ways to combine these tools to perform several common analyses.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#visualize-a-scalar-function-on-a-tree">Visualize a scalar function on a tree</a></li>
<li><a href="#visualize-a-scalar-function-on-a-graph">Visualize a scalar function on a graph</a></li>
<li><a href="#visualize-a-scalar-function-on-a-point-cloud">Visualize a scalar function on a point cloud</a></li>
<li><a href="#visualize-and-interactively-sample-a-probability-distribution">Visualize and interactively sample a probability distribution</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scalar-function-on-a-tree">Scalar function on a tree</h2>
<p>If your function is defined on a tree, then you may not need to do anything extra to visualize it with denali. Simply provide your input as a <code>.tree</code> file (see the <a href="formats.html#tree">specification</a> or the <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a> for more information).</p>
<h2 id="scalar-function-on-a-graph">Scalar function on a graph</h2>
<p>If your function is defined on a graph, you'll need to extract tree-like structure from the graph. One way to do this is to compute the contour tree of the graph. The included <em>ctree</em> tool will do this: simply provide the vertex values and edges of your graph to <em>ctree</em>, and it will output the contour tree in a file <em>denali</em> can read.</p>
<h2 id="scalar-function-on-a-point-cloud">Scalar function on a point cloud</h2>
<p>If your function is defined on a point cloud, you'll need to extract tree-like structure. One way to do this is with a contour tree. The included <em>ctree</em> tool and <em>pydenali</em>'s contour tree utilities can help do this. For more information, see the <a href="tutorial.html#visualizing-functions-on-point-clouds">Visualizing function on point clouds</a> section of the tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="visualize-and-interactively-sample-a-probability-distribution">Visualize and interactively sample a probability distribution</h2>
<p>Suppose you have many samples from a probability distribution in the form of points with associated probabilities. You can visualize the distribution as any other scalar function defined on a point cloud: by first building a nearest-neighbor graph, then building the contour tree. See the <a href="#visualize-a-scalar-function-on-a-point-cloud">Visualize a scalar function on a point cloud</a> section above for more.</p>
<p><em>Denali</em>'s callback system can be used to interactively resample the probability distribution. Simply write a <a href="callback.html">tree callback</a> to do the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Resample points around the selection.</li>
<li>Recompute the neighbor graph.</li>
<li>Pass the recomputed neighbors and new vertices into <em>ctree</em>.</li>
<li>Print the computed tree to STDOUT.</li>
</ol>
<p>Included in <code>examples/pdf</code> is a callback which does just this for a simple mixture of Gaussians.</p>
