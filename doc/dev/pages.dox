    \brief A description of the use of concepts.

    denali thoroughly uses template functions and classes. In order to 
    more rigorously define the requirements on the parameters of these generic
    structures, [concepts](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/concept_check/concept_check.htm)
    are used. This document describes the conventions adopted by denali 
    pertaining to the use of concepts.

    \section concept_classes Concept Classes
    
    A *concept* consists of a set of constraints that an implementor of the
    concept must follow: in some ways, it is like an abstract interface.  An
    *archetype* of a concept is a concrete class that implements the interface,
    but none of the functionality. In denali, *concepts* and *archetypes* are
    contained together in *concept classes*.

    As an example, consider the function below which counts the nodes of a graph:

    ~~~
    template <typename Graph>
    int countNodes(const Graph& graph)
    {
        Graph::Node node = graph.getFirstNode();
        int count = 0;

        while (graph.isValid(node)) {
            node = graph.getNextNode(node);
            ++count;
        }

        return count;
    }
    ~~~

    Here, `Graph` is a parameterized type. The following constraints are implicit:

    - `Graph` must define a `Node` type.
    - `Graph` must have the methods:
        - `bool isValid(Node)`
        - `Node getFirstNode()`
        - `Node getNextNode(Node)`

    All of this functionality is required to do a specific task: iterate over the 
    nodes of the graph. We might then say that `Graph` should conform to a
    "NodeIterable" concept.

    To make this rigorous, we define a `NodeIterable` concept class:

    ~~~
    template <typename Base>
    class NodeIterable : public Base
    {
    public:

        // the archetype:

        typedef concepts::Node Node;

        bool isValid(Node) { return true; }
        Node getFirstNode() { return Node(); }
        Node getNextNode(Node node) { return Node(); }

        // the constraints:

        template <typename _NodeIterable>
        struct Constraints
        {
            void constraints()
            {
                _Node node = _node_iterable.getFirstNode();
                _Node next = _node_iterable.getNextNode(node);
                bool valid = _node_iterable.isValid(node);
            }

            _NodeIterable& _node_iterable;
            typedef typename _NodeIterable::Node _Node;
        }

    };
    ~~~

    The constraints are defined (according to convention) in a `Constraints`
    template struct with a `void constraints()` member. The `constraints()`
    member method exercises the functionality of the concept. The
    `_NodeIterable` template parameter represents a class that is being checked
    against the concept. If the class does not meet the concept, the type checker
    should find an error in the body of `constraints()`. `constraints()`, however,
    is never executed, so we do not need to worry about making the code
    here operational.

    The archetype of the concept is defined in the concept class as well.
    It should be designed to meet the constraints, and nothing more.
    The idea is that a concept class should be self-consistent: when
    concept checking is done, a concept class should satisfy its own constraints.


    \section concept_checking Concept Checking

    denali defines several functions for checking classes against concepts. The most 
    general is `denali::concepts::checkConcept<A,B>()`. This function takes the concept
    `A` and checks that the class `B` conforms to the constraints imposed by `A`.
    For example, to check that our `NodeIterable` concept class is self-consistent,
    we would type

    ~~~
    checkConcept<NodeIterable<Null>, NodeIterable<Null> >();
    ~~~

    where `Null` is a base concept class that has no constraints and
    models no functionality, defined in denali::concepts.


    \section implementation Implementation

    The implementation of concept checking in denali is closely related to
    the concept check in LEMON's [concept_check.h](http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon/browser/lemon/lemon/concept_check.h),
    which itself is inspired by the [Boost Concept Check library](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/concept_check/concept_check.htm).

    In short, we want the `constraints()` method to be instantiated, but never run. 
    That way, static type checking is performed, but we don't have to write 
    functioning archetype code. The trick is to declared a function pointer
    to the `constraints()` method. The compiler instantiates the method
    and performs type-checking, but it is never run.

    The following code will handle the vast majority of cases. The
    `ignore_unused_variable_warning` function is used to prevent the compiler
    from complaining that our function pointer was never used.

    ~~~
    template <class T> inline void ignore_unused_variable_warning(const T&) {}

    template <typename Concept, typename Type>
    void checkConcept()
    {
        typedef typename Concept::template Constraints<Type> ConceptCheck;
        void (ConceptCheck::*x)() = &ConceptCheck::constraints;
        ignore_unused_variable_warning(x);
    }
    ~~~

    \section concept_conventions Conventions

    The following conventions should be used when writing and employing concepts:


    \subsection placement Placement of concept definitions
    All concept classes should be in the `concepts` namespace. Furthemore, the definitions
    of the concepts will be in header files in the `concepts` subdirectory.


    \subsection mixins Concept classes intended to be mixed should be stackable

    Some concept classes are obviously designed to be "mixed", such as the `NodeIterable`
    concept class. Such concept classes should be "stackable": they can be layered upon one another 
    to produce a new concept class. This is accomplished through the use of 
    mixins:

    ~~~
    template <typename Base>
    class New : public Base
    {
        // ...
    }
    ~~~

    Of course, `Base` may have some requirements on it as well. These requirements
    should be informally listed in the documentation of the concept class.


    \subsection concept_names Concept classes should not be suffixed with `Concept`.

    `NodeIterable` is the concept class describing the "NodeIterable" concept.
    Since it is in the `denali::concepts` namespace, it is clear that it is a concept.


    \subsection as_params Concepts as template parameters

    When a generic function or class's template parameter is intended to conform
    to some single concept, it should name that concept. For example:

    ~~~
    template <typename NodeIterable>
    countNodes(const NodeIterable& graph)
    {
        // ...
    }
    ~~~
    
    It should also be marked in the documentation for the function that
    `NodeIterable` refers to `concepts::NodeIterable`. If the union of
    concepts applies, name the template parameter succinctly and document
    the requirements on it elsewhere:

    ~~~
    // GraphType must conform to `NodeIterable` and `EdgeIterable`.
    template <typename GraphType>
    countNodes(const GraphType& graph)
    {
        // ...
    }
    ~~~


    \subsection Checking concepts
    
    Concepts should be checked for self-consistency in `/tests/concepts.cpp`.
