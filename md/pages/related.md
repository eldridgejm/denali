The algorithm behind *denali* is based on the previous work of William Harvey
and Yusu Wang, published as "Topological landscape ensembles for visualization
of scalar-valued functions" in *Computer Graphics Forum*, 2010.

A paper describing *denali* is under review in the Journal of Machine Learning
Research. A version of the paper as a technical report is available on the
[project page](http://denali.cse.ohio-state.edu).
