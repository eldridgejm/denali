<b>denali</b> is a tool for visualizing scalar functions defined on trees,
graphs, and point clouds as mountainous terrains. Denali helps you discover
trends in complex and high dimensional data.

<p>Many sources of data &mdash; from complex networks to probability
distributions &mdash; can be represented by tree-like structures. These trees,
however, are often complicated and difficult to visualize. Moreover, it is
often the case that one not only wants to visualize the tree-like structure of
his or her data, but also a scalar attribute on top of it. Traditional methods,
such as simply plotting the tree as a graph in the plane, offer limited
opportunities to do so.

<p>Denali is a tool for visualizing trees as <i>landscape metaphors</i> &mdash;
mountain-like surfaces which intuitively represent both the structure of
complicated trees and scalar attributes defined on their nodes. To learn more about
landscape metaphors, see the
<a href="./doc/pages/tutorial.html#introduction-to-landscape-metaphors">tutorial</a>.</p>

<i>Can denali be used for your application?</i> Denali requires its input to be in the form
of a scalar tree &mdash; a tree whose nodes are associated with scalar values. Included
with denali are tools to extract scalar tree structure from graphs and point clouds, 
allowing denali to be used to visualize many different sources of data.

Denali can be used to visualize data from many difference domains, and its powerful
callback system allows the user to tailor its behavior to his or her own data. Included
in the download are several demos and proofs-of-concept, such as:


<ul>
<li>
<h4>Probability Densities</h4> 
Visualize a mixture of Gaussians in four
dimensions as a landscape.  Clicking on a part of the landscape automatically
resamples the pdf in the region corresponding to the selection and redraws the
visualization.
</li>

<li>
<h4>Neural Network Models</h4>
Explore the parameter space of a neural network
model trained to represent the sine function.  Local minima of the cost
function are represented as plateaus in the landscape. Clicking on a component
in the visualization evaluates the corresponding model and plots its output,
comparing it to the ideal sine function.
</li>
<li>
<h4>Internet Comment Threads <i>(Pictured)</i></h4> 
Visualize the structure of an online comment
thread as a landscape. Use colors to find controversial comments. Clicking the
landscape prints the corresponding comment to the screen.

</li>

<li>
<h4>Hierarchical Clusterings</h4>
Gain an understanding of the structure of your high dimensional data by visualizing
the tree produced by a hierarchical clustering algorithm. This demo clusters images
of handwritten 0's, 1's, and 7's. Clicking a component of the landscape displays an 
average image of the digits which exist in that region.

<h4>And more...</h4>
