<p>Many sources of data &mdash; from complex networks to probability
distributions &mdash; can be represented or summarized by tree-like structures.
These trees, however, are often complicated and difficult to visualize.
Moreover, it is often the case that one not only wants to visualize the
tree-like structure of his or her data, but also a scalar attribute on top of
it. Traditional methods, such as simply plotting the tree as a graph in the
plane, offer limited opportunities to do so.

<p>Denali is a tool for visualizing trees as <i>landscape metaphors</i> &mdash;
mountain-like surfaces which intuitively represent both the structure of
complicated trees and scalar attributes defined on their nodes. To learn more about
landscape metaphors, see the
<a href="./doc/pages/tutorial.html#introduction-to-landscape-metaphors">tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>For example, suppose we visualize a hierarchical discussion on an online
forum consisting of nearly 1000 comments. If we visualize the tree using the
traditional approach, what we obtain is hard to visually parse. For example,
<i>graphviz</i> produces the visualization below. Enlarging a section of the
image shows that the result can be complex and difficult to understand, even
locally.</p>

<div style="margin: 4em 0em; text-align: center">

</div>

Below is the visualization produced by denali on the same data.

<div style="margin: 4em 0em; text-align: center">
<img src="./resources/scrot_comments.png" width="400px">
</div>

<p>Denali not only presents the complicated tree structure in an
easy-to-interpret form, but also allows the user to manipulate, zoom, simplify,
and query the landscape interactively.</p>

<p><b>Can denali be used for your application?</b> Denali can be used to
visualize such diverse structures as probability densities, complex networks,
and protein conformational spaces. At the basic level, though, Denali requires
its input to be in the form of a scalar tree &mdash; a tree whose nodes are
associated with scalar values.  Included with denali are tools to help you
extract such scalar trees from common sources of data, such as scalar functions
defined on point clouds. You can also extract tree-like structure using a
method you provide, and use denali to visualize the result.</p>

<p>The figure below shows the conceptual "pipeline" you'll follow when using denali:</p>

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0em">
<img width="600px" src="./resources/pipeline.png">
</div>

<p>The <i>extraction</i> step is crucial: it is where the input data is transformed
into something that can be visualized with denali. Included alongside denali is
<i>ctree</i>, a tool for extracting contour trees from functions defined on
graphs and point clouds. With it, you can visualize data from many different
sources. Several important applications are shown in the table below:</p>

Denali can be used to visualize data from many difference domains, and its powerful
callback system allows the user to tailor its behavior to his or her own data. Included
in the download are several demos and proofs-of-concept, such as:

    <h1>Hierarchical clustering of handwritten digit images</h1>
    Gain an understanding of the structure of your high dimensional data by visualizing
    the tree produced by a hierarchical clustering algorithm. This demo clusters images
    of handwritten 0's, 1's, and 7's. Clicking a component of the landscape displays an 
    average image of the digits which exist in that region.

    Certain type of mouse cells can be organized into a hierarchy. Given data from ten markers, forming a point
    cloud embedded in 10 dimensions, but lying on a tree-like manifold, Denali is able to recover the hierarchical structure.
    The color function shows the response of individual markers so that each cell type can be identified by the user.
