<h2 id="callback-system-overview">Callback system overview</h2>
<p><em>Denali</em> provides a flexible and powerful callback system for invoking processes upon the user selecting a component of the landscape. Some features of the system include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Callbacks may be written in any language</li>
<li>Interprocess communication is done via flat file — there is no dependency on a 3rd party messaging library</li>
<li>Callbacks can print to the status box, and even change the landscape that is being visualized.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="tutorial.html#printing-special-information-about-a-selection">Printing special information about a selection</a> section of the tutorial for a step-by-step introduction to creating a callback script.</p>
<p>The callback system works as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>When the callback is invoked, either by the user selecting a component or manually invoking the callback by pressing the callback button, a text file containing information about the selection is written to disk. This file will be referred to as the &quot;selection file&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>The callback command is run as a blocking subprocess (<em>denali</em>'s interface will be frozen until the script returns). The process is given as its first argument the path to the selection file.</p></li>
<li><p>The callback script runs. The output it prints to STDOUT is used in different ways, depending on the type of the callback:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Info</em>: the output is printed to the status box</li>
<li><em>Tree</em>: the output is interpreted as if it were the content of a <code>.tree</code> file, and the visualization is updated to represent this tree</li>
<li><p><em>Void</em>: the output is ignored</p>
<p>Any other output of the callback that isn't on STDOUT, such as that printed to STDERR, is not handled by <em>denali</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because the system communicates via files and STDOUT, callbacks may be written in virtually any language.</p>
<h2 id="the-selection-file">The selection file</h2>
<p><em>Denali</em> prints information about the selection to a temporary file. Information contained in the file includes the selected component, the members contained within the component, the path to the file being visualized, and (optionally) a list of all of the nodes and members present in the subtree induced by the selection.</p>
<p>Note that if you are writing a callback in Python, you <em>do not</em> need to know how to parse the selection file: utilities are included in the <em>denali.py</em> module which read selection files. This section is useful only to users who would like to write their own callbacks in another language.</p>
<p>The selection file is broken into sections. Each section begins with a line containing <code>#</code> followed by the section name, i.e:</p>
<pre><code># &lt;section 1 name&gt;
...
# &lt;section 2 name&gt;
...</code></pre>
<p>The <code>file</code>, <code>component</code>, and <code>members</code> sections are always present. The <code>reduction</code> section is present only when a color map has been provided to denali. The <code>subtree</code> section is present only when the &quot;Provide subtree&quot; option is set in the callback configuration dialog. And the <code>subtree_reduction</code> section is present only when both the &quot;Provide subtree&quot; option is set and a color map was provided.</p>
<p>We will now described the format and purpose of each of these sections.</p>
<h3 id="file-section"><code>file</code> section</h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Contains the full, absolute file path of the tree currently being visualized. This path is <em>not</em> changed by running a tree callback. In other words, if we open <code>/path/to/foo.tree</code> and run the tree callback, subsequent selections will still have <code>/path/to/foo.tree</code> in the file section even though the tree being visualized is not the same as the tree described by this file.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong>: A single line containing the full file path to the tree file.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<pre><code># file
/path/to/file.tree</code></pre>
<h3 id="component-section"><code>component</code> section</h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Contains the ids and scalar values of the two nodes which define the selected component.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong>: Two lines, each with two tab-separated numerical values. The first value on a line is an integer node id, the second value is a floating-point scalar value. The first line corresponds to the parent node of the component. The second corresponds to the child node. For example:</p>
<pre><code># component
&lt;parent id&gt; &lt;parent value&gt;
&lt;child id&gt;  &lt;child value&gt;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<pre><code># component
0   42.3
20  -21.1</code></pre>
<h3 id="members-section"><code>members</code> section</h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Contains a list of all of the members in a selected component and their associated scalar values. Note that the nodes defining the component are themselves members of the component by convention. In other words, if the component 0 → 20 is selected, then 0 and 20 will appear in the <code>members</code> section as well as the <code>component</code> section.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong>: Same as the <code>component</code> section, but with two or more lines (since at least the nodes defining the component are present). The order of the members is not important:</p>
<pre><code># members
&lt;node id&gt;   &lt;node value&gt;
&lt;node id&gt;   &lt;node value&gt;
&lt;node id&gt;   &lt;node value&gt;
...</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<pre><code># members
1   42.3
10  77.2
42  -4.3
11  99</code></pre>
<h3 id="reduction-section"><code>reduction</code> section</h3>
<p><em>Only present when a color map was provided to denali.</em></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: A color map is provided to denali by specifying a second scalar value for each of the nodes and members in the tree. As each edge of the tree has multiple nodes and members associated with it, it is necessary to <em>reduce</em> a set of scalar values to a single number, which is then mapped to a color. Denali provides several reduction functions, such as the mean and the covariance, for this task. This section of the file gives the result of the reduction for the selected arc.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong>: A single line containing the result of the reduction as a decimal number.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<pre><code># reduction
42.0</code></pre>
<h3 id="subtree-section"><code>subtree</code> section</h3>
<p><em>Only present when the &quot;Supply subtree&quot; option is set in the &quot;Configure Callbacks&quot; dialog.</em></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The subtree induced by the user's selection.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong>: The tree is represented using denali <code>.tree</code> format (see the <a href="./formats.html#tree">format specifications</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<p>This example shows a subtree with 9 nodes.</p>
<pre><code># subtree
9
1   62
3   66
4   16
5   32
7   39

10  3   6   64
10  9</code></pre>
<h3 id="subtree_reduction-section"><code>subtree_reduction</code> section</h3>
<p><em>Only present when both the &quot;Supply subtree&quot; option is set in the &quot;Configure Callbacks&quot; dialog, and a color map was provided to denali.</em></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The result of applying the reduction function to each of the edges in the subtree.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong>: <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=n" alt="n" title="n" /> lines, where <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=n" alt="n" title="n" /> is the number of edges in the subtree, where each line is of the form:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;parent_id&gt; &lt;child_id&gt;  &lt;reduction_value&gt;</code></pre>
<p><code>&lt;parent_id&gt;</code> is the id of the parent node of the arc, and <code>&lt;child_id&gt;</code> is the id of the child. The columns are tab-separated, as usual.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>This example shows the reduction as applied to the edges of the subtree in the previous section's example.</p>
<pre><code># subtree_reduction
4   5   32
5   1   62
5   7   39
7   8   58
7   10  53

<h3 id="an-example-selection-file">An example selection file</h3>
<p>The following selection file was generated by selecting the base component (the component representing arc 4 → 5) of the tree file located at <code>examples/tutorial/tree.tree</code>. Additionally, the color map file located at <code>examples/tutorial/tree.colors</code> was used. Note that the file is <strong>tab-delimited</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="tips-and-tricks-for-writing-callbacks">Tips and tricks for writing callbacks</h2>
<p>Included in this section are several &quot;tricks&quot; for writing callbacks.</p>
<h3 id="debugging-callback-scripts">Debugging callback scripts</h3>
<p>If your callback encounters a problem and must exit, it will most likely print the error to STDERR. For example, a python script will print an exception to STDERR before exiting.</p>
<p><em>Denali</em> does not print the output from STDERR to the status box by design (it only prints the STDOUT, and that only occurs if the callback is an &quot;info callback&quot;). Nevertheless, you can still view the error output of your callback by launching <em>denali</em> in a terminal. Anything printed by your callback to STDERR will be passed along and displayed in the console.</p>
<p>This can be awkward, however. If much debugging needs to be done, a better alternative is to copy a selection file produced by denali and simply run the callback from the shell with the path to the selection file as its first argument.</p>
<h3 id="non-blocking-operation">Non-blocking operation</h3>
<p>When <em>denali</em> runs a callback, it must wait for the callback to finish. This is because the output of the callback is used to print information to the status box and/or regenerate the visualization. This isn't always necessary, however. If you'd prefer that <em>denali</em> didn't wait while your callback was running (that is, that it worked in &quot;non-blocking&quot; fashion), then you should write a quick script in your favorite language to fork your callback in the background.</p>
<p>Another possibility is to start a <em>server</em> script before starting <em>denali</em>, and specify a <em>client</em> script as the callback. Whenever a selection is made, the small client contacts the server, telling it to perform some action. This is the route taken by the &quot;clustering&quot; example provided alongside <em>denali</em>. Look at example's python code to see how one might do this.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-paths">Working with paths</h3>
<p>This is less of a tip, and more of a warning: any callback run by <em>denali</em> inherits <em>denali</em>'s environment. This means that if you include any relative paths in your callback script, you have to be careful about where you start <em>denali</em>.</p>
