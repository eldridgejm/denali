<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p><em>Denali</em> comes complete with a variety of examples. All of these examples are located in the <code>/examples</code> folder, directly under the project root. Most of these examples are designed to show how the various features of <em>denali</em> can be used for various purposes. In particular, the callback system is demonstrated. The examples use the included python module, and may require that several python packages be installed.</p>
<h3 id="tutorial"><code>./tutorial</code></h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This is the example referenced throughout the <a href="./tutorial.html">tutorial</a>. It demonstrates color maps, weight maps, and a simple callback. The data being visualized is a toy tree; there isn't much to interpret.</p>
<p><strong>Files</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tree.tree</code>: A contour tree used throughout the tutorial.</li>
<li><code>tree.colors</code>: A color map for the above tree.</li>
<li><code>tree.weights</code>: A weight map for the above tree.</li>
<li><code>callback.py</code>: A simple info callback which prints the nodes in the selected component to the status box.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following files are referred to in the section on computing a contour tree from a point cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>data.txt</code>: A data file containing 10000 samples of a probability density in four dimensions.</li>
<li><code>makenngraph.py</code>: Builds a nearest neighbor graph for the data in the <code>data.txt</code> file and prints the vertices and edges to files. Requires the <code>numpy</code> package.</li>
<li><code>vertices.txt</code>: A vertex definition file describing points in a density function consisting of three Gaussians.</li>
<li><code>edges.txt</code>: The edges made between vertices by using the <code>makenngraph.py</code> script.</li>
<li><code>gendata.py</code>: Generates more data, like that in <code>data.txt</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: See the <a href="./tutorial">tutorial</a></p>
<h3 id="clustering"><code>./clustering</code></h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: 647 images of handwritten digits (consisting of zeros, ones, and sevens) are hierarchically clustered using single-linkage clustering. The resulting tree is visualized. This demo shows the rich callback system by displaying an average image of the digits in the selected component in a new window.</p>
<p><strong>Files</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mnist_017.npy</code>: A <em>numpy</em> archive containing the digit images.</li>
<li><code>mnist_017_labels.npy</code>: A <em>numpy</em> archive containing the labels of the images in <code>mnist_017.npy</code>. The label for an image is either 0, 1, or 7.</li>
<li><code>mnist_017.tree</code>: The tree resulting from running single-linkage clustering on the data.</li>
<li><code>callback.py</code>: The callback which shows the digits in the component when the selection is made. Requires <em>numpy</em> and <em>matplotlib</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: Load the <code>mnist_017.tree</code> file in <em>denali</em>. The three classes of digits are represented by &quot;plateaus&quot; in the landscape. To explore the landscape more thoroughly, we'll use the callback. Select <strong>File → Configure Callbacks</strong> to open the callbacks dialog. We'll use an Async callback. Browse for the callback file, and select <strong>Run on selection</strong> and <strong>Supply subtree</strong>. Click <strong>Ok</strong>, and right click to select a component of the landscape. An image will appear, showing the average of all of the digits in the subtree induced by your selection.</p>
<h3 id="comments"><code>./comments</code></h3>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: An comment thread from a website which features hierarchical discussions was scraped, and 954 comments were downloaded. Each comment has an unbounded integer score rating its popularity. This naturally yields a scalar tree, but for the ease of visualization, we make a slight adjustment to the scalar value of each node. The scalar value associated with a comment is taken to be its score, plus the score of its parent comment. This causes the landscape to grow upward.</p>
<p>Highlighted by this example are the color map and callback features. The callback prints the selected comment to the status box.</p>
<p><strong>Files</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>comments.pickle</code>: A <code>networkx</code> tree representing the discussion serialized using the Python 2 <code>pickle</code> module.</li>
<li><code>comments.tree</code>: The tree in <em>denali</em> format.</li>
<li><code>vote_ratio.colors</code>: A color map describing the ratio of upvotes to downvotes for every comment.</li>
<li><code>callback.py</code>: The python callback which prints the comments to the status box.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: Open the tree in <em>denali</em> and set the root node to be &quot;0&quot;. This node is artificially inserted into the tree to be a parent of all of the top-level comments. Next, set the color map by selecting <strong>File → Configure Color Map</strong>. Browse for the color map file. Set the &quot;Contributors&quot; to <strong>Child</strong> and the reduction to <strong>Maximum</strong>. The particular reduction used doesn't matter in this case, as we're only using the child node in the reduction set.</p>
<p>To see the content of individual comments, we'll use the callback function. As before, load the callback, but as an <em>Info</em> callback rather than an <em>Async</em> callback. Right click to select a component. The comment's score and content will be printed to the status box.</p>
